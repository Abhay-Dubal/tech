it is managed database of in memory and caching open-source databases .

Amazon ElastiCache is a cache-as-a-service

it is used when we need to improve the performance of our application by adding caching layer infront of database.

It utilizes Memcached and Redis, and manages to considerably reduce the time your applications would, otherwise, 
    take to read data from disk-based databases. 

AWS ElastiCache currently acts as an in-memory key-value store with sub-millisecond latency — 
    consequently allowing web applications to quickly retrieve data over and over again without the need to reperform the queries. 

ElastiCache doesn’t offer a lot of options when it comes to integration. 
You can only connect it to databases and applications that are hosted by Amazon.
