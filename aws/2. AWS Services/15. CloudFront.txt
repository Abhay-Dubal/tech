Amazon CloudFront employs a global network of edge locations and regional edge caches that cache copies of your content close to your viewers. 
Amazon CloudFront ensures that end-user requests are served by the closest edge location.

it is more advance and cost effective than elastic cache.

Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, 
    and APIs to customers globally with low latency and high transfer speeds.

CloudFront also integrates with-AWS WAF, a web application firewall that helps protect web applications from common web exploits, 
    and-AWS Shield, a managed DDoS protection service that safeguards web applications running on AWS.
    WAF => Web Application Firewall

In other words, your web visitors load content from the closest caching server, instead of relying entirely on the original hosting server. 

Benefits :

    1. Reduce latency   (100 GbE fiber delivering ultra-low latency performance and high availability to end users)
    2. Improve security  (integrate AWS WAF, managed rules, and managed third-party firewall options into CloudFront workloads.)
    3. Cut costs     (pay-as-you-go , CloudFront consolidates requests and removes data transfer out fees from your AWS origins)
    4. Customize delivery    ( enable you to securely run your own code at the AWS CDN edge. )
