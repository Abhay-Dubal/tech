BASH Syntax

save bash file as :   FILENAME.sh

run it as :       ./FILENAME.sh

1. Print output

    echo "TEXT TO PRINT"

    echo "Bash version ${BASH_VERSION}..."  

    echo ${BASH_VERSION}            # Prints Bash version without Quotes

    sleep 8         # sleep for 8 sec , 

    date +"%H:%M:%S"       # print date

1.1 Comment

    # This is a comment

2. define variables

    VARIABLE_NAME="VALUE"

    VARIABLE_NAME=VALUE     # e.g. name=rahul     OR    marks = 100

    VARIABLE_NAME=`command`

2.1. Get User Input

    read -p "Enter your name: " name    # we enter the input on the same PROMPT by using the -p

    echo "Hello $name"   # shell variable expansion will only work with double-quotes.

    echo 'Hello $name'     # it will display Hello $name as it is without any expansion.


2.2 Command line argument

    args=("$@")  
  
    echo ${args[0]} ${args[1]} ${args[2]} ${args[3]}  

3. IF statement

    if [ condition ];  
    then  
    <commands>  
    elif [ condition ];  
    then  
    <commands>  
    else  
    <commands>  
    fi  

    e.g.

                    if [ $a -gt $b ];  
                    then  
                        echo "X is greater than Y  " 
                    elif [ $b -gt $a ];  
                    then  
                        echo "X is less than Y  "  
                    else  
                        echo "X is equal to Y  "  
                fi


                # if with and  : if [[ 10 -gt 9 && 10 == 9 || 2 -lt 1 || 25 -gt 20 ]];  

3.1 switch case

    case $Answer in  
    Yes|yes|y|Y)  
        echo "That's amazing."  
        echo  
        ;;  
    No|no|N|n)  
        echo "It's easy. Let's start learning from javatpoint."  
        ;;  
    esac  


    e.g.


        read Answer

                case $Answer in  
                    Yes|yes|y|Y)  
                        echo "YES"   
                        ;;  
                    No|no|N|n)  
                        echo "NO"  
                        ;;  
                esac  



4. For Loop

                            Using {START..END..INCREMENT} syntax:

    
    for i in {0..10..2}    # start with 0 upto 10 with increment of 2 like 0,2,4,6,8,10
    do 
        echo "Welcome $i times"    # shell variable expansion will only work with double-quotes.
    done

5. Arithmetic Operators

    var=10
    var=20

    let "add = $(($var1 + $var2 ))"  
    acho "add = $add"
