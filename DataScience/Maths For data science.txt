Scaler : a physical quantity that is completely described by its magnitude; examples of scalars are volume, density, speed, energy, mass, and time.

Vector : a measurement or a quantity that has both size and direction represented by an arrow whose direction is the same as that of the quantity and whose length is proportional to the 		quantity's magnitude

	Dot Product : Dot Product of vectors is equal to the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors, and the cosine of the angle between the two vectors

	Cross product : The cross product a Ã— b is defined as a vector c that is perpendicular (orthogonal) to both a and b

	eigenvector is a vector whose direction remains unchanged when a linear transformation is applied to it , Eigenvalue :The scalar that is used to transform (stretch) an Eigenvector

Matrix : rectangular array or table of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns, which is used to represent a mathematical object or a property of such an object.
		it converts vector equations to arrays so that computer can perform operations on that

	for matrices multiplication , row of mertics 1 should be equal to column of metrics 2

	determinant of a matrix reflects how the linear transformation associated with the matrix can scale or reflect objects.
