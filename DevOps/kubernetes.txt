simply container management/orchestration tool , also known as k8s , Container orchestration automates the deployment, management, scaling, and networking of containers.
orchestration means clustering of any no of containers running on any network , it can works on also hybrid cloud also
Kubernetes was originally developed and designed by engineers at Google. it was developed in Golang , it supports menifest scripts in JSON and Yaml

container orchestration to automate and manage tasks such as:

	Provisioning and deployment
	Configuration and scheduling 
	Resource allocation
	Container availability 
	Scaling or removing containers based on balancing workloads across your infrastructure (can scale vertically[amount of resources] as well horizontally[no of containers])
	Load balancing and traffic routing 
	Monitoring container health
	Configuring applications based on the container in which they will run
	Keeping interactions between containers secure
	batch execution (manifest are used like recipe)

it is  Container as a Service (CaaS) . CaaS is cloud service that allows software developers and IT departments to upload, organize, run, scale, manage and stop containers by using 	container-based virtualization

Alternatives:
	AWS Fargate.
	Azure Container Instances. 
	Google Cloud Run.
	Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) 
	Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) 
	Openshift Container Platform. 
	Rancher. 
	Docker Swarm.
	Apache marathon 


Kubernetes comparison with its top compatitor docker swarm :

	it has gui but swarm does not have
	it is complex and harder than swarm but it has more features than swarm
	data sharabilty is only within pod in case of kubernetes but in swarm it is sharable throughout all containers
	swarm only supports only while k8s supports  Docker, containerd, CRI-O, and any implementation of the Kubernetes CRI 
	it has support of auto scaling in both direction but swarm does not have
	k8s has its own monitering tool but swarm needs 3rd party tool to perform this


Architecture :

	it has master- node architecture inside a cluter , node is pod which can have 1 or more worker containers runnign in it , containers communicates with pods , diff pods can have diff types of container services running in it , like in 1 pod 20 docker containers are running but in 2 nd pod from same cluster can have 30 OpenVZ or containerd conatiners running at same time 
	containers run microservice
