Ansible was introduced in 2012 by AnsibleWorks, is now owned by Red Hat,  it is an open-source and also has an enterprise version (Ansible Tower).
Ansible is agenteless , agent has not installed on node , it directly communicates through ssh directly
it was designed In Python (not Ruby) and is meant to be lightweight and have fast deployment
scripts for ansibke are written in YAML(yet another markup language) which is clode to english and also machine understandable
Ansible was a command-line-only tool. Now you can get a UI if you use the enterprise version, but itâ€™s by no means perfect
it is Push Based Configuration Management Tool
ansible is terminolgy used as make communaicaation without delay between 2 devices which is on diff planet
chef and puppet are more popular than ansible , also ansible community is not grown as much now
chef has cookbook -> recipe but ansible has playbook
technically not fully automate as we need to push for configuration
