Amazon EMR helps you analyze and process vast amounts of data by distributing the computational work across a cluster of virtual servers running in the AWS Cloud. 
The cluster is managed using an open-source framework called Hadoop. 

Amazon EMR lets you focus on crunching or analyzing your data without having to worry about time-consuming setup, management, and tuning of Hadoop clusters 
    or the compute capacity they rely on.

Amazon EMR (previously called Amazon Elastic MapReduce) is a managed cluster platform that simplifies running big data frameworks, such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark ,
     on AWS to process and analyze vast amounts of data.

Amazon EMR is a cloud big data platform for running large-scale distributed data processing jobs, interactive SQL queries, and 
            machine learning (ML) applications using open-source analytics frameworks such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, and Presto.
