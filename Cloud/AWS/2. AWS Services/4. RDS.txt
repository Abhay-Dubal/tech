RDS is a service that supports multiple SQL database engines.
it supports MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server (requires license), Oracle (requires license), and Amazon Aurora.

if Encryption is enabled, then backups , snapshots are also encrypted 

Multi AZ deployment :  aws synchronizes rds within multiple zones as stand by copy , if main instance fails , then standby instance will be used
                        only one engine is active at a time
                
READ Replica   :   only Read operation can be performed on standby instance to improve performance , to use this Automatic  backup should be enabled
                it can be cross AZ , Cross-region also



Amazon Aurora (Aurora) is a fully managed, MySQL- and PostgreSQL-compatible, relational database engine. 
It combines the speed and reliability of high-end commercial databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open-source databases. 
It delivers up to five times the throughput of MySQL and up to three times the throughput of PostgreSQL without requiring changes to most of your existing applications.

Aurora has minimum 3 AZs containing 2 copies each at all times i.e 6 
only one engine is active at a time for write and other acts as read replica
snapshots can be shared with other aws account , backups and failovers are handled automatically


RDS on VmWare allows you to deploy RDS supported DB engines on an on-premise-datacenter having VmWare server virtualization.
