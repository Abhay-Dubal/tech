EBS (elastic block storage ) is network based persistant block of storage that is designed to store data in the cloud.
we can use it as  a virtual HDD forinstance 

it exist in same AZ as the instance

it is used to for attaching persistent storage to a single virtual machine at a time

Throughput (throughput) is the speed at which data is transferred from one place to another.

bandwidth (bandwidth) is the amount of data that can be transferred in a given amount of time.

it is available in diff kinds of drive :

    1. SSD    => General purpose without speciual requirements    16000 iops
    2. IOPS SSD   =>   really fast input and output                   64000 iops 
    3. Thriooghput HDD   =>   magnetic disk with high throughput            500 iops
    4. Cold HDD    =>    low cost for infrequent access of data             250 iops
    5. EBS magnetic  =>   used for archival purpose                     100 iops




Encrypt Unencrypted EBS volumes :  (encrypted snapshot of ebs can not be shared but unencrypted snapshot can be shared with another aws accounts)

    1. Create snapshot of unencrypted volume
    2. copy snapshot to new volume with Encryption enabled
    3. create AMI from new volume and use it for new instance


we can take snapshot of EBS volume while instance is running but it is not recommended to do so.

-----------------------------------------  instance Store volume -------------------------------------------------

temporary storage for instance that is attavhe to hot machine physically  , it can not be stopped and it is ephemeral

used for cache or logs
