EBS (elastic block storage ) is network based persistant block of storage that is designed to store data in the cloud.
we can use it as  a virtual HDD forinstance 

it is used to for attaching persistent storage to a single virtual machine at a time

Throughput (throughput) is the speed at which data is transferred from one place to another.

bandwidth (bandwidth) is the amount of data that can be transferred in a given amount of time.

it is available in diff kinds of drive :

    1. SSD    => General purpose without speciual requirements    16000 iops
    2. IOPS SSD   =>   really fast input and output                   64000 iops 
    3. Thriooghput HDD   =>   magnetic disk with high throughput            500 iops
    4. Cold HDD    =>    low cost for infrequent access of data             250 iops
    5. EBS magnetic  =>   used for archival purpose                     100 iops
