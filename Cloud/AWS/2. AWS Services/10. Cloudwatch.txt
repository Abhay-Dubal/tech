use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your log files from Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, 
AWS CloudTrail, and other sources. You can then retrieve the associated log data from CloudWatch Logs

 CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and the applications you run on AWS in real time. 
You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are variables you can measure for your resources and applications.
Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service for AWS cloud resources and the applications you run on AWS. 
You can use Amazon CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, set alarms, and automatically react to changes in your AWS resources. 

By default basic monitoring is for 5 minutes. You can configure up to 1 minute but cost higher


Cloudwatch provides :

        1. Logs    - cant be stored seperately in cloudwatch ,requires Log group . by default they are stored indefinately and never expire

        2. Metrics   - based on logs represents time ordered set of data points  like CPUUtilization , NETWORKIN . it has predefined metrics just need to enable
                        Cloudwatch metric is time oreded set of data points  , we can use query to retrive data from metric
                        For custom metrics , we can define high resolution i.e. data collected upto every 1 sec  , only available in custom metrics

        3. Alarms      -  trigger notification based on metrics , Cloudwatch alarm moniters cloudwatch metrics based threshold 

        4. Dashboards    -  visualizations of metrics

        5. Events        - Action based on condition/cron



Amazon CloudWatch can monitor AWS resources such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon DynamoDB tables, and Amazon RDS DB instances, 
as well as custom metrics generated by your applications and services, and any log files your applications generate


Some of metrics requires CloudWatch Agent to be installed on the instance via scripts like log collection , disk space utilization , memory utilization , etc
