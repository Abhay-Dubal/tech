Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, 
    and APIs to customers globally with low latency and high transfer speeds.

Amazon CloudFront employs a global network of edge locations and regional edge caches that cache copies of your content close to your viewers. 
Amazon CloudFront ensures that end-user requests are served by the closest edge location.

it is more advance and cost effective than elastic cache.


CloudFront also integrates with-AWS WAF, a web application firewall that helps protect web applications from common web exploits, 
    and-AWS Shield, a managed DDoS protection service that safeguards web applications running on AWS.
    WAF => Web Application Firewall

In other words, your web visitors load content from the closest caching server, instead of relying entirely on the original hosting server. 

cached content on CloudFront can be protected via signed URl or signed cookies.
