Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a reliable, highly-scalable hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between applications or microservices. 
It moves data between distributed application components and helps you decouple these components

it provides queues for high-throughput, system-to-system messaging. 
You can use queues to decouple heavyweight processes and to buffer and batch work. 
Amazon SQS stores messages until microservices and serverless applications process them.

Use case : queue up transation email like reset , login

it is not real-time . for real-time use cases Kinesis is used
